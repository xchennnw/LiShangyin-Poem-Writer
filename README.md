# LiShangyin-Poem-Writer
This is a small project using Neo4j to generate chinese traditional poems. 
The txt files are poems wrote by Li Shangyin to be loaded into our database. 
The file called Li.py is used to build the neo4j database. And the file called Liju.py is the final python file to get the poem we generate. Liju4.py is the last version.
